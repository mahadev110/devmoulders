                Plastic injection moulding provides tight tolerances and
                repeatability and is ideal for high volume production of plastic
                moulded parts. Injection-moulded plastic parts can be
                manufactured using a wide range of thermoplastic polymers,
                resins and elastomers, making it an ideal and cost-effective
                process for various industries and applications.
              </p>

              <p>
                Injection moulded parts are created by pouring raw plastic resin
                into a hopper, then heating the resin and injecting it into a
                custom mold. Pressure is used to accommodate shrinkage and once the
                plastic molded part has fully cooled, the mold is opened, and
                the parts are removed. Because of the tight tolerances, plastic
                injection molding is a suitable option for both standard and
                intricate plastic molded parts of all sizes.

                Dev Moulders specializes in custom plastic injection molding (or
                “moulding”) and provides services for industries including
                aerospace, medical and consumer products, electronics and home
                appliances. With our precision injection molding capabilities,
                we can create thousands or millions of identical parts. From
                simple to complex designs for parts between 0.5 g and 500 gms.,
                we deliver precision plastic injection molding to match your
                unique specifications.
