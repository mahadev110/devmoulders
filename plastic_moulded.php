                Plastic injection moulding provides tight tolerances and
                repeatability and is ideal for high volume production of plastic
                moulded parts. Injection-moulded plastic parts can be
                manufactured using a wide range of thermoplastic polymers,
                resins and elastomers, making it an ideal and cost-effective
                process for various industries and applications.

              <p>
                Injection moulded parts are created by pouring raw plastic resin
                into a hopper, then heating the resin and injecting it into a
                custom mold. Pressure is used accommodate shrinkage and once the
                plastic molded part has fully cooled, the mold is opened, and
                the parts are removed. Because of the tight tolerances, plastic
                injection molding is a suitable option for both standard and
                intricate plastic molded parts of all sizes.
