                A wiring harness is an organized set of wires, terminals and
                connectors that run throughout the entire Product and relay
                information and electric power, thereby playing a critical role
                in “connecting” a variety of components.

                Wiring harness as the name indicates is a string of cables and
                wires that are used to tie down the informational signals or
                operating currents to transmit it to their destination. They are
                nowadays used in the electrical, electronics as well as the
                automotive industries.
